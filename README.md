## Why I abandoned this project
I really enjoyed working on this project. I researched, experimented and learned a lot about:
NodeJS, ExpressJS, MognoDB and PIXI.js

However, I think I got to the point that all that was left was to "just" add a few features and scenes to the game, and add a huge amount of game data (like: maps, characters, store items, spells and more)

Therefore, I came to the conclusion that I did not have much programming material left to learn from the continuation of this project ...
