# Contributing to Magic Bamba
right now, i am working on the core of the game, so it is less practical to contribute code.
but there is a couple of things you can surely contribute:
- write (and update) code documentation.
- propose future features.
- make more of everything: spells, maps, clothes, enemys.
- start working on future features.
- propose better: APIs, working methods, designed views, gaming ideas.
