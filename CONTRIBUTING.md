Please [create a **detailed** issue](https://github.com/dvirberlo/game/issues) and let me know if you wish to fix it yourself.

## Some main sections you can contribute:
### Graphics
Most of the graphics files are in `/public/images/game` directory.
Please use any kind of texture packer ([an open-sourced one i used](https://github.com/odrick/free-tex-packer), and its [online version](https://free-tex-packer.com/app/))

I really suck in this stuff so please help me!
### Code
#### Client side
Which mean mostly one of the two:
- jQuery: all thos little scripts any website needs.
- PIXI.JS: the graphics manager.
#### Server side
Which mean mostly one of the two:
- Express.JS: keep the server light and safe.
- Mongoose: keep the database efficient and modulary.
