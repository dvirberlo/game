## general

Password encryption: reight now no password encryption. it is just a game so if some hacker wants to progress in his friend's user- he will easily get his password.
just to consider later.

## server side

right now, i am using ejs engine, but the real usage of it is small.
should think about it later
hoping it will not be a monolog anymore :(

## client side

game.js should do anything, just load others codes and data:
1. dataManager.js
2. canvasManager.js
3. connectManager.js

right now, i am using callback function as the main method because i know it well.
maby should consider another method, more simple one.
